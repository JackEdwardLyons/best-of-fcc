## Description
I wrote this app to learn more about Fullstack web development with Vue and Firebase.
You can find my blog post here: https://jacklyons.me/lessons-learned-from-building-a-full-stack-vue-firebase-app/

The app is live here, it might take a little while to wake up as it's hosted for free via Firebase.
